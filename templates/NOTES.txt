Vertica's Kafka Scheduler has been deployed.

{{ if .Values.initializerEnabled -}}
The initializer pod is running. You can exec into it and run your vkconfig
commands with this command:

kubectl exec -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -it {{ include "vertica-kafka-scheduler.initializer-fullname" . }} -- bash

{{ end -}}
{{ if .Values.launcherEnabled -}}
{{- if eq (.Values.replicaCount | int) 1 }}
The launcher deployment object was created with a replica size of 1. You can
monitor the output of the pod with this command:

kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} deployment/{{ include "vertica-kafka-scheduler.fullname" . }}
{{- else if eq (.Values.replicaCount | int) 0 }}
The launcher deployment object was created, but no launcher pods are running
since the replica count is 0.
{{- else }}
The launcher deployment object was created with multiple replicas. A leader election process occurs to decide the pod that actually handles the traffic. You can list the pods with this command:

kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --selector vertica.com/kafka-scheduler-component=launcher
{{- end }}
{{ end }}
